# Deep_Learning_Real_Estate_Demo

A project for a class on neural networks where a deep-learning network was used to predict house prices. The goal was to follow the universal machine learning workflow in regards to training, validation, and testing. The data for this project was taken from kaggle.com. All of the neural networks in this project were built using the TensorFlow and Keras libraries.
